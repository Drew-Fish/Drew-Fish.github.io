            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I am currently a senior at Decatur Township School for Excellence with a G.P.A. of over 4.0. I have been successful in many advanced classes 
                such as AP Calculus AB and AP Computer Science Principals where I received a 5 on both AP tests (which is the highest score.) During the summer before my senior
                year I participated in Nextech’s Catapult program. This program, which partners with Kenzi Academy, teaches
                UXUI design, professional skills, and programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I have many different interests and hobbies, many of which revolve around music. I have played cello in my school’s
                jazz/funk band since 7th grade. I recently started composing my own music. I also love listening to music
                and collecting vinyl. As far as my interests outside of music; I love photography, fishing, hiking, and billiards.</p>
