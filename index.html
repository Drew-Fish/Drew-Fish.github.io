    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I am currently a senior at Decatur Township School for Excellence with a G.P.A. of over 4.0. I have taken many advanced classes such as AP Calculus AB and AP Computer Science Principals. During the summer before my senior year I participated in Nextech’s Catapult program. This program, which partners with Kenzi Academy, teaches UXUI design, professional skills, and programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I have many different interests and hobbies, many of which revolve around music. I have played cello in my school’s jazz/funk band since 7th grade. I recently started composing my own music. I also love listening to music and collecting vinyl. As far as my interests outside of music, I love photography, fishing, hiking, and programming.</p>
    <h3>Aspirations</h3>
    <p>Currently, I aspire to study mechanical engineering at Purdue University or Rose Hulman Institute of Technology. However I am also looking at a career in technology. I like to problem solve, that is why I am attracted to engineering and the technology sector. </p>
